# Introduction
Welcome to FinPay project, your comprehensive virtual assistant designed to enhance your online shopping experience and financial management. Navigating the vast world of e-commerce can be overwhelming, and keeping track of your spending, savings, and product choices often feels daunting. Our mission is to simplify this process, providing you with the tools and support you need to make informed decisions effortlessly.

# Project Overview
Our Goal
Our primary objective is to provide you with expert advice, recommendations, and suggestions, so you can confidently make the best choices when shopping on Amazon. Whether you're looking for a TV or any other product, our chatbot is here to simplify your online shopping journey.

# How It Works
Our chatbot is powered by a state-of-the-art Language Model (LLM) based on Gemini API. When you interact with our chatbot, it uses this advanced model to understand your queries, preferences, and needs and generates a query based on all that information then we do a string matching search with our database based on the query generated by our LLM model. It then provides you with personalized, informative, and relevant responses, by matching just like a seasoned salesperson would in a physical store.
